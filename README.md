Ideas:
- College Housing Rental Site that would exclusively allow college affiliates (student and faculty) to look for housing easily and reliably all year long.
- E-Commerce Store. Many of our favorite sites have an e-commerce app embedded in it, even if it is a small shopfront. They are omnipresent and most developers are called upon to build one at some point in their career, which is why I want to start now with the opportunity to do so.
- COVID-19 Tracker where users can track local and global coronavirus cases with live statistics and snapshots of confirmed cases by geographic location.
